I wrote this code was for a project during my research intership at Sorbonne Universit√© from September 2024 until January 2025.

I have used it to track and better understand the motion of different spinning top launches. Here are some comments about the different files: 

1.0-find-parameters-image-processing

This code is used to play around with image processing parameters such as blurring, binarization thresholds and the area threshold. If Troubleshoot = True it will print binarized and blurred image. The parameters are then stored as a json file. 

2.0-find-apex-cm-matrix

Here the apex and center of mass values are found and saved as a json file. 

2.1-load-matrices

The matrices are printed for troubleshooting
